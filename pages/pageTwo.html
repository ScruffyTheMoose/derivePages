    <h1 style="margin-left: 0%;">Wiener Process</h1>

    <p>Because I have the sense of humor of a child, while scrolling across the page for random walks the first thing
        that caught my eye was 'Wiener Process'. That's because its halarious.

        Now, I could have continued this incredibly funny series of articles, with the next being called 'Classical
        Wiener Space', but I chose to go another direction in the name of science.
