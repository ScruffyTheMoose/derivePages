    <h1 style="margin-left: 0%;">Wiener Process</h1>

    <p>
        Because I have the sense of humor of a child, while scrolling across the page for random walks, the first thing
        that caught my eye was 'Wiener Process'. That's because its halarious.

    </p>

    <p>
        What exactly is a Weiner Process? I've got no idea. Anyways...

        I could have continued this trend of silly names, with the next article being titled 'Classical
        Wiener Space', but I chose to go another direction in the name of science.
