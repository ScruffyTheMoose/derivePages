    <h1 style="margin-left: 0%;">De&#769rive</h1>

    <p>
        When introduced to the concept of a de&#769rive, I was immediately reminded of Random Walks. As a result, I
        chose
        to start off with the associated wikipedia page.
    </p>

    <p>
        A random walk is a series of steps, where each successive step is independent and equally as random as any step
        that came before. This is in many ways similar to a de&#769rive, where we are choosing (mostly) random paths to
        take as we navigate across wikipedia.
